# User-Conversion-Rate-Opimization
conversion is a type of lower funnel objective in terms of funnel analysis. As we perform analysis on advertising or user data, one key metric is conversion, which can be interpreted as conversion from user to advertiser or conversion from upper funnel spend to lower funnel spend. Usually, the goal would be either to understand the conversion rate across different user/advertiser segments and provide further granularity to enrich the dataset or to predict the conversion rate based on the behavior or characteristic data.
