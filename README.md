# User-Conversion-Rate-Optimization
Conversion is a type of lower funnel objective in terms of funnel analysis. As we perform analysis on advertising or user data, one key metric is conversion, which can be interpreted as conversion from user to advertiser or conversion from upper funnel spend to lower funnel spend. Usually, the goal would be either to understand the conversion rate across different user/advertiser segments and provide further granularity to enrich the dataset or to predict the conversion rate based on the behavior or characteristic data.

## Goal
- The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts conversion rate, and based on the model, come up with ideas to improve revenue.

## Data description
- We have data about users who vist our site
- We have different characteristics of these users, such as: country, age, are they new user or not, where the source come from, total page they visited
#### Thus, we want to:
- Predict conversion rate
- Give recommendations for the product team and marketing tema to improve conversion rate
